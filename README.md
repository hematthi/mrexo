# MRExo 
[MRExo](https://shbhuk.github.io/mrexo/) is Python script for non-parametric fitting and analysis of the Mass-Radius (M-R) relationship for exoplanets.

We translate Ning et al. (2018)â€™s `R` script\[1\] into a publicly available `Python`
package called `MRExo`\[2\]. 

`MRExo` offers tools for fitting the M-R relationship to a given data
set.  Along with the `MRExo` installation, the fit
results from the M dwarf sample dataset from Kanodia et al. (2019) and the Kepler
exoplanet sample from  Ning et al. (2018) are included. The code also includes predicting functions (M->R, and R->M), and plotting functions to generate the plots used in the below preprint.

For detailed description of the code please see our preprint manuscript - 
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190300042K>

We are waiting for the referee review, and are also working on a detailed tutorial for using this package. After that will also upload the package on to PyPI for easy `pip` install. In the meanwhile, feel free to email me or raise an issue if you have any issues with running this code.
